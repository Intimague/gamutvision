<p><strong> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gamutvision ICC profile visualization/analysis software  released </font></strong><br />
  <br />
Boulder, Colorado - August 23, 2006 - Imatest  LLC announces the release of <strong>Gamutvision</strong><em>, </em>a  powerful program for visualizing digital color workflows and color management operations. Gamutvision  is much more than just a gamut viewer. You can view gamut  mappings and rendering intents in depth, and you can preview the effects of   workflow settings and materials on your final output.  <br />
<br />
With Gamutvision<em><strong> </strong></em>you can</p>
<ul>
  <li>View the gamuts of color spaces, displays, and  printers, based on their ICC profiles.</li>
  <li>Visualize gamut mappings and rendering intents.</li>
  <li>Compare total device gamut to the actual mapped (achievable  real-world) gamut.<br />
  </li>
  <li>View color response and gamut mappings for <em><strong>all </strong></em>saturation  and lightness levels, not just the gamut surface.</li>
  <li> Evaluate ICC profile quality.</li>
  <li>Preview printer, paper, and photo lab performance using <a href="http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/tour_gamutvision.html#profdownload">downloaded  profiles</a>.</li>
  <li>Analyze the performance of your printer using <a href="http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/tour_gamutvision.html#printest">scanned  test prints</a>.</li>
  <li>See precisely how image colors will change <a href="http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/tour_gamutvision.html#images">when  printed</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gamutvision's versatile displays allow you to examine ICC profiles and  gamut mappings with unprecedented precision and detail. You can view  input and output gamuts in 3D L*a*b* space and on 2D a*b*, xy, and  u'v' planes, and you can view Black &amp; White response curves. You display  all important color difference metrics,  including Delta-E, Delta-E 94, and Delta-E CMC. And you can use these  metrics to preview how images change when sent to printers-- a far more  accurate and informative approach than the traditional gamut  warning.<br />
  <br />
Gamutvision can be used by</p>
<ul>
  <li>Photographers: professional and prosumer</li>
  <li>Manufacturers and reviewers of printers, papers, and profiles</li>
  <li>Graphic arts studios and print shops</li>
  <li>Students of photography and color management</li>
</ul>
<p>The image below shows a 3D L*a*b* gamut volume in the Gamutvision window  (reduced slightly):  the wireframe is the Adobe RGB (1998) workspace. The solid is the  output, mapped with (relative) Colorimetric rendering intent. The  controls make it easy to compare different profiles and settings.</p>

<p> The display can be changed with a click or two. Delta-E 94 color  differences and Black &amp; White density response are shown below. </p>
