<h2><a name="install"></a>Install Gamutvision </h2>

<p>If you haven't dowloaded <span class="module">Gamutvision</span>, go to the <b><a href="../download">Gamutvision
download page</a></b> before proceding. If you plan to install <span class="module">Gamutvision</span> on a computer that will <b><i>not</i></b> be conected to the Internet during
installation (or if you are behind a strong corporate firewall), download
the Matlab runtime library,
<b><a href="../packages/Imatest-lib.exe">Imatest-lib.exe</a></b>
(8.5 MB), to the same folder as the Gamutvision installer file. This only needs to be done on the initial installation, not for updates. If <a href="../packages/Imatest-lib.exe">Imatest-lib.exe</a> is not in this folder during installation, the installer attempts to download
it from the Internet. </p>


<blockquote>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#990000"><font size="-1">You must have administrator priveleges on your computer during installation. This is rarely an issue, except on networked systems with strong security. </font></font></font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#990000"><font size="-1">If
    you have a strong personal firewall, you may need to disable it before you install
    Gamutvision for the first time. You may re-enable it when the installation
    is complete. This should not be necessary on subsequent installations.</font></font></font></b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Open Windows Explorer and double-click on the Gamutvision installer file, Gamutvision-<i>version</i>.exe.
(<i>Version</i> is the version number, 1.<em>n.m</em>. The <a href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> contains the update history.) The version is displayed in the welcome window. Follow the instructions
in the installation wizard (mostly clicking
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"><u>N</u>ext
&gt;</font></font>). The Gamutvision installation requires approximately 34 MB
(mostly the Matlab libraries).</p>

When you install <span class="module">Gamutvision</span> you agree to the terms of the Gamutvision license, which allows an individual user to install and use the
software on (A) a maximum of three computers (for example, home, laptop,
and office) used exclusively by a single individual, or (B) a single workstation
used nonsimultaneously by multiple people, but
not both. It is not a concurrent use license. The full text of the license can be found <a href="license.html">here</a>. </p>
<p><span class="module">Gamutvision</span> can be run by clicking the Gamutvision icon&nbsp;<img src="images/Gamutvision_icon_16.png" align="bottom" height="16" width="16">
on the Desktop, the Start menu, or in the Gamutvision installation folder (C:\Program
files\Gamutvision in English language installations). Instructions for running <span class="module">Gamutvision</span>
are located in <a href="gamutvision.html">Gamutvision instructions</a>.
More <span class="module">Gamutvision</span> documentation is located in the <a href="index.html">Gamutvision Documentation
page</a>.</p>
<p>When you first run <span class="module">Gamutvision</span>,
it will be in evaluation mode, which allows up to 20 ICC profiles to be analyzed. Evaluation mode has all the capabilities of&nbsp; the registered
version except that there is a watermark in the background of several of the plots.</p>

<p>You can upgrade to full unrestricted version by <a href="../purchase">purchasing</a> and <a href="#register">registering</a> <span class="module">Gamutvision</span>. </p>

After you purchase Gamutvision you'll receive two e-mails. (1) An immediate confirmation
of your purchase. (2) A confirmation that your credit card has been accepted.
This may take a few minutes. You may register Gamutvision as soon as you receive
this e-mail; it contains the password you need to register. These e-mails
are cluttered with text from Regsoft. The password is near the middle.  If you don't receive the email within about fifteen minutes, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> or go to the <a href="http://www.regsoft.com/how%20to%20contact%20us%20-order.shtml" target="_blank">Regsoft Order Questions</a> page.</p>
